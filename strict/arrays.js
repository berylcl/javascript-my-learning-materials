//we work for a company building a smart home thermometer. Our most recent task is
//"Given an array of temperatures of one day, calculate the temp amplitude

//what is amplitude ? difference between highest and lowest temperatures
//what a sensor errorand what to do when one occurs
//Given an array of forecasted max temperatures ,the thermometers displays a string with these temperatures
